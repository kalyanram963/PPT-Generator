üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your AI PPT Generator up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm or Yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-ppt-generator.git
cd ai-ppt-generator

(Replace https://github.com/your-username/ai-ppt-generator.git with your actual repository URL)

Install dependencies:

npm install
# OR
yarn install

Firebase Project Setup
Create a Firebase Project:

Go to the Firebase Console.

Click "Add project" and follow the steps.

Enable Firestore Database:

In your Firebase project, navigate to "Firestore Database" from the left menu.

Click "Create database" and choose "Start in production mode" (or "test mode" for quick setup, but remember to update security rules later). Select a location.

Set up Firestore Security Rules:

In the Firestore Database section, go to the "Rules" tab.

Replace the existing rules with the following to allow authenticated users to read and write their own data:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{documents=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

Click "Publish".

Enable Authentication:

In your Firebase project, navigate to "Authentication" from the left menu.

Go to the "Sign-in method" tab.

Enable the "Anonymous" provider. This is used for initial user sign-in in the Canvas environment.

If you plan to use custom tokens or other methods, enable those as well.

Get Firebase Configuration:

In your Firebase project settings (click the gear icon next to "Project overview" -> "Project settings").

Scroll down to the "Your apps" section.

If you don't have a web app yet, click the </> icon to "Add app to get started" and register your web app.

Copy the firebaseConfig object. It will look something like this:

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

Update App.js with Firebase Config:

Open src/App.js.

Locate the firebaseConfig constant.

Crucially, ensure the firebaseConfig variable is correctly set up to use the __firebase_config global variable provided by the Canvas environment. If you're running outside Canvas, you'll need to hardcode your actual config here. The current code handles this:

const firebaseConfig = typeof __firebase_config !== 'undefined' ?
  JSON.parse(__firebase_config) :
  {
    // YOUR HARDCODED FIREBASE CONFIG IF RUNNING OUTSIDE CANVAS
    apiKey: "AIzaSyBxS4mHXP_4eFAgs_ZYRDZTAdtD4wj_g6Q", // Replace with your actual API Key
    authDomain: "ai-ppt-generator-project-27b39.firebaseapp.com", // Replace with your actual Auth Domain
    projectId: "ai-ppt-generator-project-27b39", // Replace with your actual Project ID
    storageBucket: "ai-ppt-generator-project-27b39.firebasestorage.app", // Replace with your actual Storage Bucket
    messagingSenderId: "138509839503", // Replace with your actual Messaging Sender ID
    appId: "1:138509839503:web:3d76c2f4eea4fb44c014fa", // Replace with your actual App ID
    measurementId: "G-VGL8KDQX7P" // Replace with your actual Measurement ID (optional)
  };

API Keys Setup
Google Gemini API Key:

Go to the Google AI Studio to generate a Gemini API key.

Open src/App.js.

Locate const geminiApiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";

Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your actual Gemini API key.

Pexels API Key:

Go to the Pexels API website to request a free API key.

Open src/App.js.

Locate const pexelsApiKey = "YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY";

Replace "YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY" with your actual Pexels API key.

Run the Application
npm start
# OR
yarn start

This will open the application in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.
